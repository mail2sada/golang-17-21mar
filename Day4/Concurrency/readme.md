✅ Worker Pool – Limit concurrent workers
✅ Pipeline – Data flows through multiple stages
✅ Pub-Sub – Broadcast messages to multiple receivers
✅ Or-Done – Gracefully handle cancellation

Auto-Tuning Worker Pool in Go
Load-Shedding Worker Pool (Dynamic Rate Limiting)
Pipeline with Intelligent Batching
Priority-Based Goroutine Scheduler
Pattern: Auto-Tuning Worker Pool
Load-Shedding Worker Pool – Dropping low-priority tasks under heavy load
Dynamic Batching – Aggregating requests dynamically based on load
Priority Queue Processing – Executing tasks based on urgency
Timeout-Based Execution – Avoiding stuck goroutines with context.WithTimeout
Resource Pooling – Efficiently managing expensive resources

Auto-Tuning Worker Pool – Adjusting worker count dynamically based on load
Backpressure Handling – Controlling the input flow to prevent overload
Event-Driven Goroutines – Processing only when triggered
Leaky Bucket Algorithm – Managing request throttling
Token Bucket Algorithm – Controlled concurrency with precise rate limits

Goroutine Affinity Model – Pinning goroutines to CPUs for performance
Actor Model in Go – Isolating state using independent goroutines
Transactional Memory Concurrency – Safe state modifications without locking
